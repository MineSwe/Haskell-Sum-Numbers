# Haskell Introduction (DD1337 Week 2)
By Marcus
## Description of repo
This provides a solution to the Kattis problem [Summera tal](https://kth.kattis.com/courses/DD2016/plusplus24/assignments/q4npcz/problems/kth.javap.sumsort) which includes a function in haskell that gets a list and sums the biggest half of it.
I've done this in another github repo and did a copy and paste of all the files which seems to automatically import my issue tracker, but links it to the old repo so if there's any problems with the .git folder that's why.
## Build Instructions
### [Summera tal](https://kth.kattis.com/courses/DD2016/plusplus24/assignments/q4npcz/problems/kth.javap.sumsort)
To launch this function, download the [sumnumbers.hs](https://github.com/IndaPlus25/msorberg-haskell-intro/blob/main/sumnumbers.hs) file and type:
```
main
*list length*
*list* (example: "1 2 7 5")
```
Then the program will print out the sum of top half of the list!
